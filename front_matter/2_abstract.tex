\section*{Abstract}
Exero Technologies develop adaptive sports equipment for people with disabilities. The Spike™ is an exercise and entertainment product for people with disabilities below their waist. It is currently in beta prototyping phase. Exero Technologies want the Spike™ to be finalized and ready for the market. 
\par
This master thesis is the continuum of the master thesis research project "Finalizing Exero's Spike™ prototype for production". This thesis utilizes a mixture of different product development methodologies and prototyping stages to finalize the design of Spike™. Methods such as Set-Based Design, Experience Prototyping and Minimum Viable Product are deemed most suited for this project. This master thesis determines the manufacturing location and process for the Spike™, domestic and abroad. A local manufacturer in Trondheim, Norway is sufficient for producing the first 5-20 units of the Spike™. For mass production of 20+ units, 3a Prototyping in Zhongshan, China is a sufficient manufacturer.
\par
The results of this thesis is the basis for a market-ready production of Exero's Spike™ .
